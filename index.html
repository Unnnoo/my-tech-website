            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>A CS enthusiast exploring the world of AI and technology. This website is my first project, built with the help of Gemini! I'm passionate about the intersection of creativity and data, with a focus on Machine Learning, Web Development, and Data Science. I use this space to document my journey as I learn, experiment with AI, and showcase the projects I build along the way.</p>

                <h3>How I Built This Website with AI</h3>
                <p><strong>June 28, 2025</strong> - It all started with a simple idea: could I build a website without writing a single line of code myself? In this post, I'll walk through the process of using Gemini to generate the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and how we deployed it using GitHub Pages...</p>
